# Home-Assistant-Wundergroundpws v1.X.X
Home Assistant custom integration for Weather Underground personal weather station users.  
Includes a native Home Assistant Weather Entity and a variety of weather sensors.  
Current conditions are generated from the wundergroundpws configured pws_id.  
Forecast is generated from the Home Assistant configured latitude/longitude.  
The `wundergroundpws` platform uses [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com) as a source for current weather information.

# Installation Prerequisites
Please review the minimum requirements below to determine whether you will be able to
install and use the software.

- wundergroundpws v1.1.X requires Home Assistant Version 2023.1 or greater
- wundergroundpws v1.0.2 requires Home Assistant Version 2022.11 or greater
- Registered and active Weather Underground personal weather station API key 

# Weather Underground PWS API Key
Free API keys are only issued to registered and active Weather Underground personal weather station users.  
To use this integration, you need a Weather Underground personal weather station API key and Station ID.  
To get a free API key:  
1) You must have a personal weather station registered and uploading data to Weather Underground.  
    a) Join weather Underground  
    b) Sign In  
    c) My Profile -> My Weather Stations  
    d) Add a New PWS  
2) get API key at  https://www.wunderground.com/member/api-keys.  

Please consider this when using the following information.


# Installation
Download the latest v1.X.X release zip file from this repository.
Extract the zip file to a temporary directory.
-------
Stop Home Assistant. If you do not stop the Home Assistant instance, changes to the sensors in configuration.yaml will cause a restart failure, and you will have to reboot the device.    
Copy the custom_components directory from the extracted file into your .homeassistant directory
and the www directory from the extracted file into your .homeassistant directory.  
or  
copy the contents of the custom_components directory from the extracted file into an existing custom_components directory in your .homeassistant directory
and the contents of the www directory from the extracted file into an existing www directory in your .homeassistant directory.  
To add Wundergroundpws to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
# REQUIRED
wundergroundpws:
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
  pws_id: YOUR_STATION_ID

# Required to generate HASS weather Entity for weather forecast card
weather:
  - platform: wundergroundpws

# Required if you wish to add sensors
sensor:
  - platform: wundergroundpws
    monitored_conditions:
      - temp
      - dewpt
      - heatIndex
```
Restart Home Assistant

# Upgrade
UPGRADE NOTE v1.1.0: BREAKING CHANGE -  Requires Home Assistant v 2023.1 or later.  
UPGRADE NOTE v1.0.0: BREAKING CHANGE -  Requires Home Assistant v 2022.11 or later.  
UPGRADING FROM v0.8.X REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CONFIGURATION.YAML.  
See "Example configuration.yaml entry" above.  
TO UPGRADE:
1. Stop Home Assistant. If you do not stop the Home Assistant instance, changes to the sensors in configuration.yaml will cause a restart failure, and you will have to reboot the device.
2. Delete contents of existing "custom_components/wundergroundpws" directory.
3. Download the latest v1.X.X release zip file from this repository.
4. Extract v1.X.X zip file and copy the contents of the "custom_components/wundergroundpws" directory into the existing "custom_components/wundergroundpws" directory.
5. Modify your configuration.yaml, to resemble the "Example configuration.yaml entry" above.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. Existing sensors in any entity cards should be the same.  
8. In lovelace, add a "weather forecast" card selecting the "weather.YOUR_STATION_ID" entity and save.  

        
# Description of terms and variables

                   The station id will be used to display current weather conditions.  
                   Note - Case Sensitive. Must match the ID of your Wunderground device in member settings.
      required: true
      type: string
    numeric_precision:
      description: Optional - Show PWS data as integer or decimal.
                   Only applies to PWS current values (not forecast) in sensors (not weather entity).
      required: false - Value of 'none' or 'decimal'
      type: string
      default: none
    calendarday_temp:
      USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - Undocumented in The Weather Company PWS observations API:
      description: Optional - if true, retrieve Forecast temperature max/min relative  
                   to calendar day (12:00am -> 11:59pm) as opposed to API period (~7:00am -> ~6:59am).    
                   Only affects the weather entity forecast values, not the sensors.  
                   This field is undocumented in The Weather Company PWS API,  
                   so it is subject to change and if removed from API response in the future, will crash the integration if set true.

Note: While the platform is called “wundergroundpws” the sensors will show up in Home Assistant as “WUPWS” (eg: sensor.wupws_weather_1d).
</p>

[//]: # (Note that the Weather Underground sensor is added to the entity_registry, so second and subsequent Personal Weather Station ID &#40;pws_id&#41; will have their monitored conditions suffixed with an index number e.g.)

[//]: # ()

# Localization

Sensor "friendly names" are set via translation files.  
Wundergroundpws translation files are located in the 'wundergroundpws/wupws_translations' directory.
Files were translated, using 'en.json' as the base, via https://translate.i18next.com.  
Translations only use the base language code and not the variant (i.e. zh-CN/zh-HK/zh-TW uses zh).  
The default is en-US (translations/en.json) if the lang: option is not set in the wundergroundpws config.  
If lang: is set (i.e.  lang: de-DE), then the translations/de.json file is loaded, and the Weather Underground API is queried with de-DE.    
The translation file applies to all sensor friendly names, EXCEPT wupws_weather_1d(n) through wupws_weather_5d(n).  
wupws_weather_1d(n) through wupws_weather_5d(n) translations are supplied by the Weather Underground API.  
Available lang: options are:  
```
'am-ET', 'ar-AE', 'az-AZ', 'bg-BG', 'bn-BD', 'bn-IN', 'bs-BA', 'ca-ES', 'cs-CZ', 'da-DK', 'de-DE', 'el-GR', 'en-GB',

Weather Entity (hass weather card) translations are handled by Home Assistant and configured under the user -> language setting.
